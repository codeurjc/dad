# This configuration is a simplified example of how to use SSL Termination with ssl (https) on front (haproxy) with haproxy certificates loaded from a directory,
# and plain http backends (web application does not have https enabled)
# The example provides a statistics page on /stats?admin.
# No load balancing mode is specified, therefore http (level 7) is used by default.
